Layouts
===

Layouts are specific styles regarding a certain page or major site section,
such as "blog page" or "search results".

Don't use this for abstract, self-enclosed pieces of functionality that can
be dropped into many site sections, such as social widgets or availability
calendars.
That kind of stuff should go in "Components".

__Please try to make these styles as easy to customize as possible!__

Define new variables wherever possible for colors or anything else that you think might change for specific projects.
