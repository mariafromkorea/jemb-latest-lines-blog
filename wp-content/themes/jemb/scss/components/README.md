Components
===

Components are abstract, self-enclosed pieces of functionality, such as social
widgets or availability calendars that can (theoretically) appear in many site
sections.

Don't use this for very specific things such as "blog page" or "search results".
That kind of stuff should go in "Layouts".

__Please try to make these styles as easy to customize as possible!__

Define new variables wherever possible for colors or anything else that you think might change for specific projects.
