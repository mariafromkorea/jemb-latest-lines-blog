# VRWEB FOUNDATION SASS #
==

## Structure Overview ##
Our sass is organized in the following folders:
--
* __Base__ initialization, global styles and mixins
* __Components__ abstract, self-contained content that can be dropped anywhere
* __Fonts__ font stacks
* __Layouts__ specific styles for certain pages or major site sections
* __Themes__ default and project-specific themes


Additionally, there are 3 files in this folder's root:
--
* __vrweb-settings__ This is the main settings file for rezFusion and it's where you can customize your project-specific theme
* __ie__ This implements support for Internet Explorer 8. __Don't ever edit this!__. Instead, use the "theme/ie" partial. See below for more information
* __vrweb_foundation__ This is the main sass file and pulls everything together. __You should never edit this__


Working with rezFusion Foundation
--
* You should be working from within a cloned theme (using the Drush command)
* Customize the variables defined in "vrweb-settings"
* Customize the variables defined in the various partials in the "theme" folder
* Add extra partials in the "theme" folder and import them in "vrweb-settings"
* Make Internet Explorer-specific changes in the "theme/ie" partial, it will automatically get included only for Internet Explorer 8 and below
* Treat this theme as your own; add images, fonts, js, as usual
* Profit

# THEMING SPECIFICS AND BASE UPDATES #
==

## This theme uses Gulp and Libsass to compile SCSS
- To use gulp, run `npm install` in the theme directory
- To compile sass and reload your browser run `gulp`
- There are no more Ruby dependencies in the theme


## New Coding Standards ##
- NO MORE CSS3 COMPASS MIXINS!!
- Write CSS3 styles according to spec, and Gulp will add vendor specific prefixes for you


# GET STARTED WITH YOUR DESIGN #
==
* [Download the VRW theme PSD] (https://drive.google.com/a/bluetent.com/file/d/0B7fxjELxN9xzZlpPT2NFdkpJeHM/edit?usp=sharing)
	1.Ignore all locked folders/layers
	2. 'AG' in a layer name means it is 'Autogenerated' and does not need to be customized, but shown b/c they will render on the front end
	3. It is important to read the notes where they exist

* Step 1: Set your colors in the 'COLORS' folder. 
	1. Select a neutral scale, and a branded/actionable color scale (default teal on PSD)
	2. Set these to their corresponding variables on _vrweb_settings.scss

* Step 2: Theme the Header / Topbar
	1. Expand the folder for "Header/Topbar"
	2. The folders for theme/header and theme/topbar correpsond the same file stack in this scss directory
	3. theme/topbar has two folders for topbar-touch and topbar to visually differentiate between your mobile nav and desktop nav variables respectively
	4. Layer names match the variable names you will be updating
	5. Search for 'PSD-CMZ' (for Photoshop Customize) to find the corresponding variables in your photoshop files quickly. 
	   They will all be grouped in chunks under this comment, in the same order they occur in on your photoshop file. 

* Step 3: Keep Rolling!
	1. Follow the same process for Featured-Bg, Typography, and Form components. This should comprise the first theming pass on the site. 


# HOMEPAGE QUICK SEARCH #
==
To set whether your website has popular search on the homepage:
in theme/sectiontabs, set the $popular-searches variable to true or false.

* If you have popular searches:
	1. Set $popular-searches to true;
	2. in vrweb_foudnation.scss line #75, make sure this partial is being imported

* If you DO NOT have popular searches:
	1. Set $popular-searches to false;
	2. in vrweb_foudnation.scss line #75, comment out parial import
	

# TIPS #
==
* Theme partials have corresponding partials in the components folder
* read the notes above the variables, they are seriously useful
* listed below are the theme partials you take some time setting. The rest you may or may not need to update depending on how far you decide to take it!

### You should spend some deliberate time in these theme partials:
--
* theme/typography
* theme/topbar
* theme/section-tabs
* theme/buttons

### These come second, and take less time:
--
* theme/footer
* theme/calendars
* theme/forms

# Favicons

There are literally dozens of sizes needed to match all devices but we can easily cover the vast majority of use cases with three. Here are the sizes you need:

1. **152 x 152**, for phones - android and iOS
2. **144 x 144**, for windows
3. **64 x 64**, for all other desktop browsers*

### 152 & 144 sizes

The 152 and 144 sizes should be name `favicon-152.png` and `favicon-144.png` and dropped into the `sites/all/themes/custom/vrweb_foundation/images` folder. The code will take care of the rest. Also, go to line 183 of `template.php` and change the hex color to something that goes good with your icon. This is for windows pinned sites.

### 64 size and favicon.ico

For the 64 size, go to [XIconEditor](http://www.xiconeditor.com/) and extend the 64 icon to the additional 48, 32 and 16 sizes. This will produce a single favicon.ico that should be put into the **ROOT** directory of the site. This is the most bulletproof way to deal with favicons. You can also create the different sizes your self and convert them to a favicon.ico using ImageMagick (can be installed with Homebrew) on the command line like:

`convert favicon-64.png favicon-48.png favicon-32.png favicon-24.png favicon-16.png favicon.ico`

rezFusion base has been updated to use the favicons built into the theme and therefore the favicon UI is turned off by default. If you follow these instructions the favicons will just workâ„¢ across all devices.

*_This size could even be skipped. You could use the 152 or 144 size at XIconEditor to make the 64, 48, 32 & 16 sizes_.
