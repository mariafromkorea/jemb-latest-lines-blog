Fonts
===

Define custom @font-face styles here.

Important
--

* Only the @font-face declarations should go here, assigned to a variable.
* The actual font files should go in "fonts", in the theme's root.
* Actually applying the new font variables to styles should be done in each theme's partial.
* Refer to the "default" and "foundation-icons" fonts for working examples.
