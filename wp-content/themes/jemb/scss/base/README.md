Base mixins
===

* __variables__ The contains default Foundation variables
* __normalize__ The contains the [Normalize CSS library](git.io/normalize)
* __init__ This is the main partial and it includes everything we use in the required order
* __mixins__ This contains some mixins used globally by rezFusion
* __common__ This file includes global overrides for Zurb Foundation and some global styles for rezFusion
* __drupal__ This file persists certain Drupal core styles for things we actually want to keep

You will probably only ever have to edit "common" and "mixins" for custom project themes.
